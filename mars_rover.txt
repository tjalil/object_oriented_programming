INPUT:
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
 
The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. 
The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
 
The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.
 
Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.
 

OUTPUT
The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.
 
INPUT AND OUTPUT
 
Test Input:
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
 
Expected Output:
1 3 N
5 1 E

0,0,N means at the origin point NORTH
'L' turns the rover 90 degrees L. So if it's at origin, it will now point WEST
'R' turns the rover 90 degress R. if its at origin, it will now point EAST
'M' means moving forward one grid point in the SAME heading. 
  if it's NORTH, the y-coordinate will increment by 1
  if it's SOUTH, the y-coordinate will decrement by 1
  if it's EAST, the x-coordinate will increment by 1
  if it's WEST, the x-coordinate will decrement by 1

TEST INPUT
(5,5) => size of the grid 
bottom-left: (0,0)
bottom-right: (5,0)
top-right: (5,5)
top-left: (0,5)

start position 1 2 N => (1,2,N)
L => (1,2,W)
M => (0,2,W)
L => (0,2,S)
M => (0,1,S)
L => (0,1,E)
M => (0,2,E)
L => (0,2,N)
M => (1,2,N)
M => (1,3,N)

start position 3 3 E => (3,3,E)
M => (4,3,E)
M => (5,3,E)
R => (5,3,S)
M => (5,2,S)
M => (5,1,S)
